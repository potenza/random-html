                    <p>EO Fried gave a report.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee stated the current policy in place. She suggested adding that we don't need a litigation fund per se but adding a sentence about unanticipated legal fees.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Connolly stated that the language is confusing and we could allocate funds on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated if McEntee does not want to reserve funds specifically for litigation then we can ignore changes to this part and potentially add a section that indicates the discussion.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee stated that having a way of telegraphing use of funds for legal purposes is good.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried summarized leaving it as is and indicating that the fund can be used for litigation purposes.</p>
                    <p>Chair Campbell asked how many months the 25% reserve policy covers.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated that is 3 months.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee stated that although no one may read this each LAFCO has its own policy but it is important to put out our own interpretation of the law.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Campbell stated he did not believe it warrants having a separate legal fund but expanding on the use of the general fund for legal funds would be sufficient. He asked if adding wording that anticipated legal funds includes enforcement.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated the consensus is that there is no need to add any new language but to have a discussion with legal counsel on wording.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee suggested bringing it to the full commission as a regular item.</p>

                    <p>EO Fried presented the staff report.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee asked if saying "findings" may have an implication of something bigger.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated that there may be a legal definition in there that he is not thinking about. He suggested that it could say "The EO at the next meeting shall report as to the information behind the decision and inform the commission of any approvals."</p>
                    <p>Commissioner McEntee suggested shorter wording.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried suggested "approvals and justifications".</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Connolly asked for clarification on if this was for expediency or for an emergency.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated for expediency.</p>
                    <p>Chair Campbell asked if there was anything that could get the commission in trouble by adopting a policy like this.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated that it could backfire if a future EO is not paying attention to the politics or what is going on, causing an uproar in the public.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Campbell asked if it needs chair approval, continuing that having chair approval may be necessary.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated no it would not need chair approval. Continuing on to state that the only place where chair sign-off is needed and getting removed is for Emergency OSA's which need immediate attention.</p>
                    <p>Chair Campbell stated if an EO has the ability to bypass the commission it should at least have chair sign-off to have checks and balances.</p>
                    <p>EO Fried stated that should be done for non-emergency OSA's.</p>
                    <p>Chair Campbell agreed that not needing chair sign-off for emergencies but requiring them for non-emergency OSA's.</p>
                    <p>A consensus was reached on what needed chair consultation and what did not, and correct wording was discussed to reflect that.</p>

                <p>Commissioner McEntee asked to state this more explicitly.</p>
                <p>EO Fried stated that would be stated in the Staff Memo, but stated more shortly in the fee schedule.</p>
                <p>Commissioner Campbell stated that it appears he is incentivizing this, and asked how the agency can tell who they are and aren't receiving money from.</p>
                <p>EO Fried summarized that it would be by looking at tax rolls and who they are and aren't receiving money from.</p>
                <p>Chair Campbell asked how this would play out on Paradise Dr. and if parcels are receiving service but Tiburon will not take them in despite servicing them.</p>
